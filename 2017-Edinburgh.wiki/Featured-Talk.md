## Featured Talks

Featured Talks can run about 30-45 minutes based on the topic and the speaker's materials. Featured Talks will be picked and scheduled ahead of time from the list of posted abstracts. The schedule for will be settled the week before the event and notices will be sent to all.

The actual length of the talk may be constrained by the time available. If we have lots of great talks, we might need to shorten the presentation time. If only a few people propose Featured Talks, we'll be able to allocate more time to each talk.

If, for some reason, your proposed Featured Talk is not selected, you will be invited to offer it as a [Five In Five](five-in-five) talk.
