## About Open Conference

RESTFest is structured in an Open Conference style. That means everyone who attends will be encouraged to present what we call a [Five-in-Five](five-in-five) Talk (see link for details).

Here are some other resources on Open Conferences and Unconferences to give you a better idea of what to expect at RESTFest UK 2017 this year.
