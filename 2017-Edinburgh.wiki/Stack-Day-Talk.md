### Stack Day Talks

Stack Day Talks are medium-length talks (30-45 mins) that focus on tools, libraries, and framework for building APIs and Web apps. If you've been using a tool or framework that you really love, you can share it in a Stack Day Talk.  

Similar to [Feature Talks](featured-talk), Stack Day Talks give you more time to get into the details of a library or coding pattern and even provide live demos. 

If you want to do a Stack Day talk, add it to your [People Page](speakers) and add your talk to the [Agenda](agenda) on Friday.

Feel free to post questions on the [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rest-fest), too.
