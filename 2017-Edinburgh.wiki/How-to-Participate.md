Based on the OpenSpaces model, REST Fest puts developers front-and-center with a handful of selected speakers, "open mic" style Lightning Talks (a.k.a FiveInFives) where anyone can present about anything, and access to a "Hack Space" where people can get together and work on whatever interests them.

This serves as a simple step-by-step guide on how to get involved in this year's REST Fest.

## Steps

1. Register as an attendee here: https://ti.to/rest-fest/rest-fest-uk-2016?moons=2

2. Create a people page in the [wiki](https://github.com/RESTFest/2017-Edinburgh) for yourself: 

   Start by creating a new page on the wiki [here](https://github.com/RESTFest/2017-Edinburgh/wiki/_new), with your name as the title. Then introduce yourself briefly and propose your ideas for talks you're interested in giving. "How To..." talks are encouraged as well as "How Do I?" talks. 

   Each talk proposal should include a title and short abstract (250 words or less). You may also indicate if you would like the talk to be a Lightning Talk  (Five Slides in Five Minutes), or a longer “Featured” talk (30 minutes).

3. Add your name to the [Speakers](https://github.com/RESTFest/2017-Edinburgh/wiki/Speakers) page by editing it on the wiki, and link it to your people page.

4. Sign up on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rest-fest) and introduce yourself to the group! :)
