## HackDay Landing Page

This year the HackDay is a wide open event. If you've got ideas on what kinds of projects you want to work on, add them to this page and invite people to join you. It is fine if you just want to use this year's HackDay as a way to catch up on some of your own OSS efforts, too. Feel free to add that, too.

### Project Ideas
 * Triage bugs on an existing project/framework
 * Organize a feature sprint
 * Spend time writing docs and/or demo code for an existing project
 * Finally start that new OSS project you've always wanted to create
 * [add your ideas year]
 * 

### HAL-FORMS Spec Cleanup and Sample Implementations.
I'm looking for a couple people willing to help clean up the HAL-FORMS spec and build some samples. Maybe w/ HAL creator Mike Kelly there, we can make some serious traction? [[Mike Amundsen|Mike-Amundsen]]

### OpenACalendar

Working on something around my wiki calendar project - more on my page: [[James Baster|james-baster]]

### The power of proxies

Demonstrate how proxies can be used to enhance a very basic API (even just some plain text on a HTTP end point). Each person on team can create something to layer onto the stack to demonstrate the concept of a layered architecture in a fun but somewhat impractical demonstration! [[Ben Longden|ben-longden]]

### Simple servers and (really) clever clients

Using a server as a messaging system to pass messages between clients of different types (manager and player for examples). This was done last year at the US REST Fest event to build REST Chess. We could build on that idea and see where it could go. [[Ben Longden|ben-longden]]

### HypermediaHub ###

A website which acts as a hub for hypermedia apis, consisting of
 - a directory of APIs which API developers can submit
 - users can star their favourites, and access the APIs through an (extensible) generic HTML client 
 - it might be interesting to integrate Ben's proxy idea above, so that users could apply proxies of their choice to their apis (e.g. the generic client could be applied using a proxy) [[Harry McIntyre|harry-mcintyre]]
