A "Five In Five" talk is really the same as a "[Lightning Talk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk)." The idea is to prepare just five slides and complete the talk in five minutes.

The thought is that everyone has at least five minutes of a talk in them!

All you need to do is add one or more proposed Five-In-Five talks to your [People Page](speakers) and then add your name to the [Agenda](agenda) in one of the Five-in-Five slots.
