Welcome to the 2017-Edinburgh wiki!

The first RESTFest to be conceived outside of it's home in Greenville, SC. We're going to follow the same format for RESTFest, but do it on a different continent. We've picked Edinburgh as a host city due to having a nearby international airport and simply, because it's Edinburgh (and who doesn't love Edinburgh?).

This page will serve as a template of how the event will go. The ground rules...

1. Upper limit of 60 people
1. Thursday / Friday / Saturday
1. Everyone speaks, everyone listens
1. Food. Make it good (and local)
1. Hackday on day 1
1. Stack day 2 (with keynote)
1. Main talks on day 3
1. A bar crawl/whisky tasting on day 1
1. Games / film night after the keynote on day 2 (or a hike up Arthurs seat for people that want to do it...)
1. After party on day 3

Provisionally, we have a venue at [Codebase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com/) inside [Argyle house](http://www.argylehouseedinburgh.com/). The building itself is well known if not hugely impressive, but it's location at the foot of Edinburgh Castle and its proximity to bars, restaurants and accomodation on Grassmarket and Royal Mile make it somewhat ideal. They're well set up for tech meetups too (and host many local user groups etc) so there wouldn't be too much to do there.

The dates I have been talking about are 14th, 15th and 16th July (massively subject to change, and subject to me visiting the venue in the new year once their refurb has been completed to make sure it's suitable - though I think it will be!).

The entrance will be [here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@55.9469525,-3.2023021,3a,75y,59.87h,92.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sR486BmLvwmYzNqkqaR1kxw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) so you can get a feel for where i'm talking about.

[Filament Coffee](http://filamentcoffee.com/) apparently have a little cafe on site and can supply "really great" coffee on request. Once I see the venue i'll get in touch with them and make sure we have a regular supply!
