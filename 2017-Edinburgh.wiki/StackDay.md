## StackDay

### Demos, Tutorials, and More
StackDay is a chance for everyone to show off their favorite tools, libraries, tips and tricks. Unlike the [[5in5|Five-in-Five]] and [[Feature Talks|Featured-Talk]], [[StackDay talks|Stack-Day-Talk]] can be anywhere from a short five minute "tip talk" to an extended interactive demo/tutorial of more than an hour. StackDay is a great day for getting your hands on new tools and kicking the tires on products you've always wanted to try.

So far, we've to the following StackDay presentations lined up:

 * [[Hypermedia Client Tutorial|Hypermedia-Client]] (90 minutes) by [[Mike Amundsen|Mike-Amundsen]]. 
 * [[REST and the RPC resurgence: Will RESTful APIs be forever fused to HTTP|rest-and-rpc]] (60 minutes) by tyk.io
 * [add your StackDay presentation here]

We're working to line up other StackDay presentations now. If you've got an idea for one, just add it to your [[People Page|speakers]] and place the link here.
