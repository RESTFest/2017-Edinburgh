## Panel Discussions

At this year's WS-REST we're offering at least two 30 minute slots for panel discussions. In keeping with the [Open Conference](about) style, these discussions are selected by the attendees, not the organizers. The time is set aside to allow attendees to lead the discussions and focus on topics of their interest.

### Establishing a Panel
It's very easy to establish an Open Discussion panel at RESTFest. Just enter a topic into one of the open slots and link to a wiki page where you can enter the topic title, an optional abstract/description, and a series of starter questions for the panel. Anyone who would like to participate can add their name to the list of panelists. Of course, all attendees can contribute to Open Discussion panels, too.

We'll allocated 30-45 minute time slots in the [Agenda](agenda) as panel proposals roll in. Feel free to add a Panel Discussion to your [People Page](speakers) and let us know when you'd like to schedule it.
### Suggested Topics

If you'd like to see a panel discussion, but don't really want to "take the baton" to lead it, feel free to add your topic ideas here and encourage others to take the lead.

If you'd like to see more topics on this list, just edit the wiki page.
